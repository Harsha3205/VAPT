The primary goal of this initiative is to establish a comprehensive methodology for conducting Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) on Internet of Things (IoT) devices and networks. This methodology integrates various testing techniques, tools, and procedures to identify vulnerabilities, simulate real-world attack scenarios, and enhance the security of IoT ecosystems. It provides a structured framework to enforce robust security policies and measures for IoT devices.
According to the OWASP IoT Security Testing Guide, the methodology should be flexibly expandable, enabling the addition of more detailed test cases for specific technologies over time. It should also enable the comparison of test procedures and results, regardless of specific technologies or device types, and serve the purpose of a common language between manufacturers/operators and penetration testing service providers, facilitating communication between both parties by establishing a comprehensible terminology. Furthermore, the methodology should be efficient, supporting penetration testing teams without requiring major changes to any established workflows or additions of any new steps or testing phases.
